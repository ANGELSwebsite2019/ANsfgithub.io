            <p>
            The planet is swimming in discarded plastic which can cause harm to animals and human health. Can we still put an end to it?
              <br><br>
             Plastic pollution became one of the most pressing environmental issues, as rapidly increasing production of disposable plastic products overwhelms the worldâ€™s ability to deal with them. Plastic pollution is most visible in developing Asian and African nations. But in this developed world, especially in countries with low recycling rates, also has trouble properly collecting discarded plastics which causes rapid increase in plastics thrown or discarded.
